# ChatBot Demo Project

This project demonstrates how to integrate a chatbot into a webpage using HTML, showcasing the ease with which a chatbot can be added to any website to provide an interactive chat popup feature for users.

## Getting Started

Integrating the chatbot into your webpage involves a simple two-step process:

1. **Include the JavaScript:** Add the following script tag within the `<head>` section of your HTML page:

    ```html
    <script src="https://ajayos.github.io/chatBot/bot.js"></script>
    ```

2. **Add the Chatbot Placeholder:** Place the following `<div>` tag within the `<body>` section of your HTML page where you want the chat popup to appear:

    ```html
    <div class="chatbot-by-ajay-os"></div>
    ```

This setup ensures that the chatbot's script is loaded when the page is loaded, and the chatbot itself is displayed where you've placed the `<div>` tag.

## Features

- **Easy Integration:** With just a couple of lines of HTML, you can add a fully functional chatbot to your site.
- **Customizable:** The chatbot's appearance and responses can be customized to fit the theme and tone of your website.
- **Interactive Experience:** Enhances user engagement by providing immediate responses to inquiries.

## How It Works

The chatbot is powered by a JavaScript file hosted at `https://ajayos.github.io/chatBot/bot.js`. When you include this script in your webpage, it automatically creates a chat popup option. Users can interact with this popup to get answers to their questions or guidance on your website.

## Usage

To use the chatbot in your project, simply add the provided HTML snippet to your webpage. You can place it anywhere within the body of your HTML file. Once added, the chatbot will automatically be available to your site's visitors.
