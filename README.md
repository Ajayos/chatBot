# ChatBot Demo Project

This project demonstrates the integration of a chatbot into a webpage using HTML. It's designed to showcase how easily a chatbot can be added to any website, providing an interactive chat popup feature for users.

## Getting Started

To integrate the chatbot into your webpage, simply include the following HTML snippet in your page:

```html
<div class="chatbot-by-ajay-os"></div>
<script src="https://ajayos.github.io/chatBot/bot.js"></script>
```

This snippet creates a placeholder for the chatbot and includes the necessary JavaScript to activate the chat popup feature.

## Features

- **Easy Integration:** With just a couple of lines of HTML, you can add a fully functional chatbot to your site.
- **Customizable:** The chatbot's appearance and responses can be customized to fit the theme and tone of your website.
- **Interactive Experience:** Enhances user engagement by providing immediate responses to inquiries.

## How It Works

The chatbot is powered by a JavaScript file hosted at `https://ajayos.github.io/chatBot/bot.js`. When you include this script in your webpage, it automatically creates a chat popup option. Users can interact with this popup to get answers to their questions or guidance on your website.

## Usage

To use the chatbot in your project, simply add the provided HTML snippet to your webpage. You can place it anywhere within the body of your HTML file. Once added, the chatbot will automatically be available to your site's visitors.
